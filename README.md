GWAS analysis

## Introduction
Body mass index (BMI) is a common measure of obesity and refer to excess body weight, which can be a risk factor for many diseases and chronic conditions. BMI can be considered a complex trait which is highly polygenic. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) can screen the entire genome of larger numbers of individuals to look for association between genetic variants within individuals and their disease traits or quantitative traits, which is a good model for finding potential genetic region with highly statistically significant associations. In this project, GWAS was conducted including more than 11 000 individuals is conducted for BMI and 2 binary traits to assess the contribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Hence, we can disclose some loci associated with these phenotypes of interest and determine their common associations.
